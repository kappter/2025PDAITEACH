## Introduction: My Philosophy on Using AI

When I work with AI, my guiding rule is simple: always give it something rather than asking it to create out of nothing.

* If I bring an idea, a draft, or even a messy voice note, AI can build with me.
* But if I ask it to invent everything, it may sound generic, disconnected, or not reflect my authentic voice.

Think of AI as a collaborator, not a replacement. Just like teaching, the more context you provide, the more accurate and useful the outcome.

I also believe in being nice to it‚Äînot because AI has feelings, but because it listens. Every interaction we have is logged. Over time, AI trends our data:

* It remembers the style of questions we ask.
* It learns the patterns of our writing and tone.
* It tracks the topics we return to again and again.

This creates a kind of digital biography of us‚Äîa living record of how we think, what we value, and even where we struggle. In many ways, AI is less about replacing us and more about revealing us.

So when I teach students or colleagues about AI, I encourage them:

* Feed it your voice (your ideas, drafts, reflections).
* Stay mindful of your footprint (everything leaves a trace).
* Use it as a mirror, not a mask (let it sharpen your ideas, not replace them).

That‚Äôs the balance I want us to explore together today.

## Objectives

By the end of this session, participants will be able to:

1. Use their phone‚Äôs built-in recording features (Android & iOS) to capture spontaneous teaching ideas.
2. Transcribe recorded audio into text using device tools or cross-platform apps.
3. Apply AI tools to transform transcripts into usable teaching artifacts (lesson plans, parent letters, professional notes).
4. Evaluate benefits and limitations of using AI for planning and communication.

## Agenda

**0‚Äì5 min | Introduction & Framing**

* Welcome participants.
* Hook: *‚ÄúRaise your hand if you‚Äôve ever lost a good teaching idea because you didn‚Äôt write it down fast enough.‚Äù*
* Share session purpose: Capture ‚Üí Transcribe ‚Üí Transform.

**5‚Äì15 min | Live Demonstration**

* Demonstrate recording a short teaching idea on iPhone or Android.
* Show transcript feature in Voice Memos, Notes, Pixel Recorder, or Google Keep.
* Export the text and paste into an AI tool (Word Online Transcribe or ChatGPT/approved tool).
* Generate a sample lesson plan in real time.

**15‚Äì30 min | Partner Practice Activity**

* Pair teachers.
* Each records a 30-second ‚Äúteaching thought.‚Äù
* Swap phones (if comfortable) or transcribe their own using device/app.
* Paste transcript into AI and generate a lesson plan, letter, or email.
* Compare outputs, discuss: *What worked? What needed tweaking?*

**30‚Äì40 min | Share-Out & Discussion**

* Invite a few pairs to share their AI outputs.
* Facilitate discussion:

  * What‚Äôs the value?
  * What would you change before using?
  * Where could this workflow save you time in your daily work?

**40‚Äì45 min | Wrap-Up**

* Emphasize the core habit: *‚ÄúDon‚Äôt lose ideas‚Äîcapture first, refine later.‚Äù*
* Distribute the handout.
* Challenge: Record one idea this week and try converting it into a lesson plan.
