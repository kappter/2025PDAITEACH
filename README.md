**Duration:** 45 minutes
**Audience:** K–12 Educators
**Facilitator:** \[Your Name]

## Objectives

By the end of this session, participants will be able to:

1. Use their phone’s built-in recording features (Android & iOS) to capture spontaneous teaching ideas.
2. Transcribe recorded audio into text using device tools or cross-platform apps.
3. Apply AI tools to transform transcripts into usable teaching artifacts (lesson plans, parent letters, professional notes).
4. Evaluate benefits and limitations of using AI for planning and communication.

## Agenda

**0–5 min | Introduction & Framing**

* Welcome participants.
* Hook: *“Raise your hand if you’ve ever lost a good teaching idea because you didn’t write it down fast enough.”*
* Share session purpose: Capture → Transcribe → Transform.

**5–15 min | Live Demonstration**

* Demonstrate recording a short teaching idea on iPhone or Android.
* Show transcript feature in Voice Memos, Notes, Pixel Recorder, or Google Keep.
* Export the text and paste into an AI tool (Word Online Transcribe or ChatGPT/approved tool).
* Generate a sample lesson plan in real time.

**15–30 min | Partner Practice Activity**

* Pair teachers.
* Each records a 30-second “teaching thought.”
* Swap phones (if comfortable) or transcribe their own using device/app.
* Paste transcript into AI and generate a lesson plan, letter, or email.
* Compare outputs, discuss: *What worked? What needed tweaking?*

**30–40 min | Share-Out & Discussion**

* Invite a few pairs to share their AI outputs.
* Facilitate discussion:

  * What’s the value?
  * What would you change before using?
  * Where could this workflow save you time in your daily work?

**40–45 min | Wrap-Up**

* Emphasize the core habit: *“Don’t lose ideas—capture first, refine later.”*
* Distribute the handout.
* Challenge: Record one idea this week and try converting it into a lesson plan.

✅ This gives you a **structured session** that feels professional while still being very practical.

Would you like me to also create a **second handout just for the activities** (like a “Partner Practice Guide” teachers can follow step-by-step during the session)?
